"Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

Instruction:
Solve the given math problem by writing a python code. Store your result as a variable named 'answer'.

Input:
John buys 3 dress shirts.  They sell for $20 each.  He also has to pay 10% tax on everything.  How much did he pay in total?

Response:
total_shirts = 3
cost_of_one_shirt = 20
total_cost_shirts = total_shirts * cost_of_one_shirt
tax_rate = 0.1 
tax_amount = tax_rate * total_cost_shirts
total_cost = total_cost_shirts + tax_amount
answer = total_cost <|eot_id|>

Input:
Arwen and Elrond picked some flowers. Arwen was able to get 20 tulips and Elrond was able to get twice as many tulips as Arwen did. How many tulips were they able to get in total?

Response:
tulips_arwen = 20
tulips_elrond = 2 * tulips_arwen
total_tulips = tulips_arwen + tulips_elrond
answer = total_tulips <|eot_id|>

Input:
A group of nine turtles sat on a log.  Two less than three times the original number of turtles climbed onto the log with the original group, creating an even larger group on the log.  Suddenly, half of the large group of turtles were frightened by a sound and jumped off of the log and ran away.  How many turtles remained on the log?

Response:
original_turtles = 9 
climbed_turtles = original_turtles * 3 - 2
total_turtles = original_turtles + climbed_turtles
remaining_turtles = total_turtles / 2
answer = remaining_turtles <|eot_id|>

Input:
James hurt himself exercising.  The pain subsided after 3 days, but he knew that the injury would take at least 5 times that long to fully heal. After that, he wanted to wait another 3 days before he started working out again.  If he wants to wait 3 weeks after that to start lifting heavy again, how long until he can lift heavy again?

Response:
days_to_heal = 3
days_to_fully_heal = 5 * days_to_heal
days_wait_before_workout = 3
weeks_wait_before_lifting = 3
days_wait_before_lifting = weeks_wait_before_lifting * 7
total_days_wait = days_to_fully_heal + days_wait_before_workout + days_wait_before_lifting
answer = total_days_wait <|eot_id|>

Input:
I caught 4 fewer fish than the number in my tank and added them to my fish tank. If the tank has 20 fish right now, how many did I add?

Response:
fish_in_tank_before = Symbol('fish_in_tank_before')
fish_caught = fish_in_tank_before - 4
total_fish_in_tank = 20
equation = Eq(total_fish_in_tank, fish_caught + fish_in_tank_before)
solution = solve_it(equation, fish_in_tank_before)
fish_in_tank_before_value = solution[fish_in_tank_before]
fish_caught_value = fish_in_tank_before_value - 4
answer = fish_caught_value <|eot_id|>

Input:
Gary is buying chlorine for his rectangular pool, which is 10 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. Gary needs to buy one quart of chlorine for every 120 cubic feet of water in his pool. If chlorine costs $3 a quart, how much does Gary spend on chlorine?

Response:
length = 10
width = 8
depth = 6
volume_pool = length * width * depth
chlorine_per_cubic_foot = 1 / 120
chlorine_needed = volume_pool * chlorine_per_cubic_foot
cost_per_quart = 3
total_cost = chlorine_needed * cost_per_quart
answer = total_cost <|eot_id|>

Input:
The number of Oreos and cookies in a box is in the ratio 4:9. Zane bought each Oreo at $2 and each cookie at $3. How much more money did Zane spend on buying the cookies than buying the Oreos if the total number of items in the box is 65?

Response:
total_items = 65
oreos_to_cookies_ratio = 4 / (4 + 9)
oreos = total_items * oreos_to_cookies_ratio
cookies = total_items * (1 - oreos_to_cookies_ratio)
cost_per_oreo = 2 
cost_per_cookie = 3
cost_oreos = cost_per_oreo * oreos
cost_cookies = cost_per_cookie * cookies
difference_in_cost = cost_cookies - cost_oreos
answer = difference_in_cost <|eot_id|>

Input:
Linda is building a new hotel with two wings. The first wing has 9 floors and each floor has 6 halls each with 32 rooms. The second wing has 7 floors each with 9 halls with 40 rooms each. How many rooms are in the hotel total?

Response:
floors_first_wing = 9
halls_per_floor_first_wing = 6
rooms_per_hall_first_wing = 32
rooms_first_wing = floors_first_wing * halls_per_floor_first_wing * rooms_per_hall_first_wing
floors_second_wing = 7
halls_per_floor_second_wing = 9
rooms_per_hall_second_wing = 40
rooms_second_wing = floors_second_wing * halls_per_floor_second_wing * rooms_per_hall_second_wing
total_rooms = rooms_first_wing + rooms_second_wing
answer = total_rooms <|eot_id|>
